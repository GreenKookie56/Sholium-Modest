an unbalanced mod made by GreenKookie  
requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/latest), [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman/releases/latest) is recommended

# What is this mod about?
this is a btd6/plague inc related mod about everything I found funny/interesting and decided to add into the game, which includes:
- unbalanced ideas
- inside jokes that are not really funny
- arts that I drew (Some were made just to be funny, some were just me having nothing to do and deciding to waste 2 hours on a 69x91)
- towers in btd6 old versions that absolutely peaked/sucked during the period
- plagues that demonstrate their playstyle in the plague inc game
- seal jokers that reduce hand size by 1 and have the effect of the original seals

# I prefer vanilla balance but i still want to see bloons content...
Check out [Bloonalatro](https://github.com/Amphiapple/Bloonlatro) for vanilla+ playstyle
